			The Chaos Preprocessor Library is a generative metaprogramming framework for C and C++ that builds on the techniques used in the <assoc id="http://www.boost.org/libs/preprocessor/doc/index.html">Boost Preprocessor Library</assoc>.
			It is primarily intended to push the state-of-the-art in the field of preprocessor metaprogramming.
			As such, it assumes a strictly conformant preprocessor in an effort to reduce limitations and provide motivation for vendors to fix their broken preprocessors.
			This reduces the current portability of the library, as many preprocessors have serious conformancy issues.
			At the same time, it functions as a reference implementation of advanced preprocessor metaprogramming concepts, idioms, and techniques.
